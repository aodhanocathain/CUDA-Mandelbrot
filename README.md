# CUDA-Mandelbrot
This is a project I took on to learn CUDA C++ basics.
In the project, I display the Mandelbrot Set in the terminal by iterating all of the points in parallel.

I also timed the device against a singlethreaded program on the host, just to make sure it was, in fact, speeding up execution :)
